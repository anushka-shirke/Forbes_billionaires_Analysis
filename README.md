Forbes Billionaires Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end analysis of a dataset on billionaires around the world. The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights regarding the demographics, geography, industries, and wealth distribution of billionaires using data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations.

~ Project Structure ~
The analysis is structured around the following key areas:

1. Data Preparation
-Handling Missing Values:
Identified and addressed missing values using techniques like forward-fill to maintain data integrity.

-Data Type Conversion:
Converted essential columns such as Net Worth from strings to numeric types for proper analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Summary Statistics:
Calculated key metrics (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation) for Net Worth to understand central tendencies.

-Wealth Distribution:
Visualized the distribution of billionaire net worth using histograms and box plots to identify skewness and outliers.

-Top 10 Richest Billionaires:
Extracted the top 10 individuals with the highest net worth using nlargest.

3. Geographic Analysis
-Global Distribution:
Analyzed how billionaires are distributed across continents and regions.

-Top Countries by Count:
Identified the top 10 countries with the highest number of billionaires using value_counts().

-Billionaire Wealth by Country:
Visualized country-wise billionaire net worth distribution using bar plots.

4. Industry Analysis
-Top Industries:
Determined which industries produce the most billionaires.

-Net Worth by Industry:
Calculated and visualized the average billionaire net worth per industry to understand wealth concentration by sector.

5. Age-Based Analysis
-Average & Median Age:
Computed the mean and median age of billionaires to understand age trends.
-Youngest and Oldest Billionaires:
Identified individuals with the minimum and maximum ages in the dataset using nsmallest() and nlargest().

Tools & Libraries Used:

-Pandas for data manipulation
-Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
-NumPy for numerical operations
-Jupyter Notebook / Python for implementation

Insights:

-Most billionaires are concentrated in a few key countries like the United States, China, and India.
-Technology and Finance are leading industries in terms of both number of billionaires and average net worth.
-The net worth distribution is heavily skewed, with a few ultra-wealthy individuals.
-The average age of billionaires tends to be around the mid-60s, but some individuals attain billionaire status in their 20s or 30s.

Files Included:

-Forbes_billionaires_Analysis.ipynb – Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis
-README.md – This file, summarizing the methodology and findings

Future Scope:

-Time-series analysis if historical data is available
-Deep dive into gender, education, or inheritance-based breakdowns
-Use of interactive dashboards with Plotly or Power BI
